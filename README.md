## üìÅ File Handling System in C++

This project is a file handling system implemented in C++. It provides essential functionalities for managing files and directories, such as viewing, copying, moving files, and creating and navigating directories.

## Features

1. **View File Content**
 
Reads and displays the content of a specified file.

2. **Copy File**
 
Copies content from one file to another.

3. **Move File**
 
Moves a file by copying it to a new location and deleting the original.

4. **Create Directories**
 
Creates a new folder in the current directory.

5. **Navigate Directories**
 
Changes the working directory.


## How to Run

1. **Compile the Code**
 
Use a C++ compiler like g++ to compile the program:

**g++ file_handling.cpp -o file_handling**

2. **Run the Program**
 
Execute the compiled program:

**./file_handling**

3. **Follow the Menu Options**
 
The program will show you a menu for different file and directory tasks.
Simply type the file paths or directory names as asked.


## Example Usage

**- View File Content**

Enter the name or path of the file you want to view (e.g., example.txt).

**- Copy a File**

Enter the source file name (e.g., source.txt) and the destination file name (e.g., destination.txt).

**- Create a Directory**

Input the name of the new directory to create.


## Requirements

**- Operating System:** Windows

**- Compiler:** A C++ compiler that supports the <filesystem> or <direct.h> library (e.g., GCC or MSVC).
